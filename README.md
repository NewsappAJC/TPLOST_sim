## TODO
- [  ] Looks terrible on mobile and a little wonky on iPad. Fix that. Needs a grid system.

- [  ] Would like to fix color scheme if we re-use this.

- [  ] Looks kinda weird how new slices are added into the middle of the pie instead of on the end - it's because the whole pie is re-drawn whenever something is added or removed so it goes in in the order of its place in the array - could fix by storing which one is new and adding it last
